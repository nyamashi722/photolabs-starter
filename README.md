# react-photolabs
The PhotoLabs project is a React-based single-page application that allows users to view photos in different contexts using a pre-existing API to build a frontend user experience for users to interact with photos. This project utilizes React hooks such as useEffect to make API fetch requests, useReducer to manage global state and custom hooks to keep logic modular.
